# 🛍️ Prodigy_ML_02 – Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project is part of the **Prodigy Infotech ML internship**. It demonstrates how to apply **K-Means Clustering** to group customers of a retail store based on their **annual income** and **spending score**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

> Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

Customer segmentation helps businesses target specific groups for marketing, product placement, and personalization.

---

## 📊 Features Used for Clustering

- **Annual Income (k$)** – Customer’s yearly income
- **Spending Score (1-100)** – A score assigned by the store based on customer behavior and spending patterns

---

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🧠 Algorithm: K-Means Clustering

- **StandardScaler** is used to normalize the data.
- **Elbow Method** is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **KMeans** is used to segment customers into clusters based on similarity.
